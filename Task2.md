## Customer Churn Prediction

# Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based business using Machine Learning. By analyzing customer data, we can identify users who are likely to leave and take action to retain them.

# Dataset
The dataset includes customer details like:
✅ Age, gender, and location
✅ Account activity and subscription history
✅ Customer engagement and churn status

# Technologies Used
🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
🔹 Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
🔹 Scikit-learn for model training

# Key Steps
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualizations
3️⃣ Feature Selection & Engineering
4️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation
5️⃣ Prediction & Business Insights

# Results & Insights
1. Gradient Boosting performed best with the highest accuracy.
2. Key factors affecting churn: Customer activity, subscription duration, and engagement.
3. Businesses can use this model to identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.
